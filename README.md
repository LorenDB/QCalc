# QCalc
QCalc is a random statistics calculator that I wrote. It's in QML with a C++ backend for the heavy lifting. It's been tested and verified to work on Linux and Android (although it's using Qt, so it *should* work anywhere). And who knows, it may suddenly acquire other features as well...

## Usage
Type in a comma-separated list of numbers (e.g. "1, 2, 2, 5, 8") (spacing does not matter) and press `Enter` or click "Use this data set".
